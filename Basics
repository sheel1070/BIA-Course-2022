What is Data? Data is info stored in digital format which can be used as base for performing analysis and decision making
2 types: Traditonal Data (Data in tables containing numeric and text values i.e. structured and can be managed from one computer) AND Big Data (extremely large data, can be structured, semi-structured and unstructured, distributed b/w many computers)
Essential V's of Big Data:
- Volume
- Variety
- Velocity
Business Intelligence (BI):
- Includes technology driven tools used for analysing, reporting and understanding past data.
- Make decisions
- Extract insights and ideas
- Answers to "How?" and "Why?"
BI Basic Working:
- Collect observations

        |
        V
- Quantify (represent observations as numbers) collected info.
        |
        |
        V
- Create Measures (accumulation of observation to show some info)
        |
        |
        V
- Metrics (values derived from measures created, gauges business progress, performance, etc.)
                   Metric = Measure + Business Meaning

        |
        V
- Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
                   KPIs = Metrics + Business Objectives  
                   Key --> Related to main business goals
                   Performance --> How successfully task is performed in specific timeframe
                   Indicators --> Most important values or metrics indicating something related to business performance

- BI Reports and Dashboards
BI Uses
- Price optimisation
- Enhancing inventory management
Traditional Methods:
- Methods derived from stats and adapted for business
- Forecast future performance with high accuracy
- Cluster analysis, regression analysis, etc.
Traditional Data Techniques
- Regression i.e. a model for quantifying causal relationships among different variables included in analysis.
                   2 types: Linear and non-linear (Logistic) Regression
     NOTE: for linear regression, y = bx where b = coefficient, x = value on x-axis i.e. independent variable and y = value on y-axis i.e. dependent variable
           In case of many variables, y = a + b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3 +____________ where x = predictor variable
                                                                                         regressor
                                                                                         independent variable
                                                                                         explanatory variable
- Cluster Analysis
- Factor Analysis i.e. reduce dimensionality of problem by generalizing a large number of variables (x1,x2,x3,----,x100) into a manageable amount of variables (z1,z2,z3,-----,z10) which can then be used in regression formula.
- Time Series i.e. observing stock prices, volume, etc. with time (t) always on the x-axis as it is independent variable.

# Cluster vs Factor Analysis
- Cluster groups observations into cluster
- Factor analysis groups explanatory variables to generalize them
Machine Learning (ML):
- Machine predicts outcomes from data without being explicitly programmed to do so.
- Predictions with unprecedented accuracy.
- Create algo based on which computer uses to find a model that fits data best to make accurate predictions.
- Uses trial and error where every trial is atleast as good as the last one.
                  Data --> Model --> Objective function --> Optimization Algorithm
- 3 Types i.e. Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning

# Programming languages vs Software
- Programming languages can be used to devise reusable programs to execute an action. Example: Python, R
- Software is a large collection of programs.

Population vs Sample:
- Full Population is hard to observe and contact.
- Sample is comparitively easier to observe and contact.

Sample Compulsory Characterstics:
- Randomness i.e. a sample is random only and only if each member is chosen from population strictly by chance.
- Representativeness i.e. a representative sample is subset of population only and only if it accurately represents members of entire population.

Types of Data
- Categorical (groups) i.e. car brands, yes/no questions, genders, etc.
- Numerical and is divided into Discrete and Continuous.
  - Discrete i.e. integer values such as number of children, number of people, grades, etc.
  - Continuous i.e. decimal values such as weight, area, distance

Measurement Levels
- Qualitative
  - Nominal i.e. cannot be ordered such as clothing brands, 4 seasons, etc.
  - Ordinal i.e. can be ordered such as months of a year, ratings, etc.
  
- Quantitative (Represented by numbers)
  - Intervals (no true 0)
  - Ratio (have a true 0)
  
  Graphs and Tables
  - Categorical Variable Representation
    - Frequency Distribution Table
    - Bar Charts
    - Pie Charts
    - Pareto Diagrams i.e. a special type of bar chart where categories are shown in descending order of frequency.
    
# Relative Frequency and Cumulative Frequency
  1. For relative frequency, calculate sum of frequency column and every frequency value by the total frequency.
                               RF = Frequency / Total Frequency
  2. Cumulative Frequency is sum of relative frequencies.
  
# Pareto Principle (80-20 rule)
  "80% of the effect come from 20% of the causes."
  
  - Numerical Variable Representation
    - Frequency Distribution Table using INTERVALS
        Interval Width = (largest no. - smallest no.)/number of desired intervals
        Conditions for number to be included in interval:
        # Number is greater than lower bound.
                         OR
        # Number is lower or equal to upper bound.
