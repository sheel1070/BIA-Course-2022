What is Data? Data is info stored in digital format which can be used as base for performing analysis and decision making
2 types: Traditonal Data (Data in tables containing numeric and text values i.e. structured and can be managed from one computer) AND Big Data (extremely large data, can be structured, semi-structured and unstructured, distributed b/w many computers)
Essential V's of Big Data:
- Volume
- Variety
- Velocity
Business Intelligence (BI):
- Includes technology driven tools used for analysing, reporting and understanding past data.
- Make decisions
- Extract insights and ideas
- Answers to "How?" and "Why?"
Traditional Methods:
- Methods derived from stats and adapted for business
- Forecast future performance with high accuracy
- Cluster analysis, regression analysis, etc.
Machine Learning (ML):
- Machine predicts outcomes from data without being explicitly programmed to do so.
- Predictions with unprecedented accuracy.
BI Techniques:
- Collect observations
- Quantify (represent observations as numbers) collected info.
- Create measures (accumulation of observation to show some info)
- Metrics (values derived from measures created, gauges business progress, performance, etc.)
                   Metric = Measure + Business Meaning
- Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
                   KPIs = Metrics + Business Objectives  
                   Key --> Related to main business goals
                   Performance --> How successfully task is performed in specific timeframe
                   Indicators --> Most important values or metrics indicating something related to business performance
- BI Reports and Dashboards
